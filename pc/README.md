# PC kernel snap

Kernel snap for running Ubuntu Core 22 on generic x86_64 hardware.

## Overview

This snap stages the pc-kernel snap and is meant to be an example of how to
shrink an already existing kernel snap without setting up all the required build
environment of a full kernel snap build.

## Building

This snap should be buildable using snapcraft:

```
  snapcraft
