summary: A StarFive VisionFive 2 board kernel for use with Ubuntu Core 24
description: |
  This snap provides the kernel, modules, firmware, and initrd required to
  create an Ubuntu Core image for the StarFive VisionFive 2.

  The kernel and initrd are provided as a single universal kernel image file
  which is then booted by the managed assets created and owned by snapd.
  Generally, this snap would also provide the device tree files for the target
  hardware. However, in this case, that device tree is provided by the u-boot
  binary in our gadget snap. If we needed it here, we could likewise add that
  file to our UKI.
